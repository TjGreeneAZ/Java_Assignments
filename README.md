# Java Assignments Repository

This repository contains a series of Java programming assignments that showcase various aspects of Java programming, from object-oriented design to handling file I/O and parsing JSON data. Each assignment folder includes a detailed description, source code, and any additional necessary files.

## Assignment Summaries

### Assignment 1: Inheritance and Polymorphism
- **Objective:** Create a `Car` class with basic car attributes and methods, then extend this class with an `ElectricCar` subclass that adds electric vehicle-specific features.
- **Key Concepts:** Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.

### Assignment 2: Character Counting in Strings
- **Objective:** Develop a program that counts the occurrences of each letter in a user-provided string, converting all to uppercase to ensure case insensitivity.
- **Key Concepts:** String manipulation, arrays, loops.

### Assignment 3: File I/O - Writing and Reading
- **Objective:** Implement two programs; one that writes user-inputted sales data to a file and another that reads the data from the file and summarizes it.
- **Key Concepts:** File I/O, exception handling, data formatting.

### Assignment 4: JSON Parsing
- **Objective:** Parse a JSON file to extract music track information and print it, handling potential errors gracefully.
- **Key Concepts:** JSON parsing, file handling, error handling, data encapsulation.

### Assignment 5: Data Structures - TreeSet
- **Objective:** Use `TreeSet` to manage and output unique words and integers from text files, showcasing data sorting and uniqueness properties.
- **Key Concepts:** Data structures, file I/O, iterators.

### Assignment 6: HashMaps and TreeMaps
- **Objective:** Manage a soccer team roster using `HashMap` and then manipulate it (add, remove, modify entries) before sorting it using `TreeMap`.
- **Key Concepts:** Data structures, map operations, custom sorting.

### Assignment 7: Stream API and Lambda Expressions
- **Objective:** Utilize Java's Stream API to process and manipulate a list of product objects in various ways including sorting and filtering.
- **Key Concepts:** Stream API, lambda expressions, method references, functional programming.

### Assignment 9: Sorting Algorithms - Bubble Sort
- **Objective:** Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers and display before and after sorting.
- **Key Concepts:** Sorting algorithms, arrays, algorithm optimization.

### Assignment 10: Stacks and Data Reversal
- **Objective:** Use a stack to reverse the words in a sentence, demonstrating the LIFO (Last In First Out) property of stacks.
- **Key Concepts:** Data structures, stacks, string manipulation.

### Assignment 11: Parallel Streams and Performance
- **Objective:** Compare the performance of sequential and parallel streams in Java while summarizing words in a text file.
- **Key Concepts:** Parallel computing, performance measurement, stream API.

### Assignment 12: SQL Database Operations
- **Objective:** Perform various SQL operations such as querying, updating, deleting, and inserting on a product table within a database.
- **Key Concepts:** JDBC, SQL queries, database manipulation.

### Assignment 13: Client-Server Date Application
- **Objective:** Implement a client-server application where the server provides current date details to the client. The server returns the complete date, month, day of the month, day of the week, and year, which the client then displays.
- **Key Concepts:** Networking, sockets, multi-threading, handling I/O streams in Java, client-server architecture.
